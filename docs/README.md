# Documentation

This is the source for documentation pages. Documentation pages are built by Gatzby, and presented by the Docz theme. 

To add pages, just add files in the `docs/src/pages` folder. If automatic deployment is set up, the new page will be automatically deployed after commiting your new content. 

Note the formatting of files: 

```
---
name: Test 1
route: /test1
menu: Resources
