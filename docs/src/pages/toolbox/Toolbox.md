An Integrated development environment (IDE) speeds up your development process, and makes life a lot easier. Several tools exist.

Git: https://git-scm.com/

GitHub is a great place to store and share your code. As long as you are having public repositories, it is free as well. Do not try to learn everything at once. Github Desktop is a great way to start using Git, without having to learn a myriad of terminal commands. https://desktop.github.com/
